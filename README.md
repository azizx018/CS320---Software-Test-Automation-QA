###How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing is a large part of ensuring that your code is functional and secure.  Testing can indicate if code is returning what you think it is returning, and tell you if a program is working as expected. Tests can also help you keep your programs secure by helping to catch bugs or vulnerabilites before they are pushed out to a production environment.  Using best coding and testing practies can also ensure code is well tested and secure. 

###How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
If can be hard to interperate user feedback and work it into a program, but it is an important part of keeping programs up to date. Listening and making sure you understand what users want is key.  Sometimes user have trouble expressing exactaly what it is they want.  So being able to take what you hear and figure out how you can make that an actionable goal and work it into a program will lead you to have better products in the end. 

###How do I approach designing software?
I like to draw things out on paper before I start.  I find that if I just dive in and start coding I get a little lost.  Mapping out relationships, classes and thinking about what would need to be included in a class or test or database table makes me feel more prepared and better able to execute the project.
